Google Genomics Cookbook
========================

Welcome to the Google Genomics Cookbook on readthedocs. 

The official Google Genomics documentation can be found at
`cloud.google.com/genomics`_. There you will find information such
as `What is Google Genomics`_,
how to `Load Genomic Variants`_ into Google Cloud for analysis,
and details of the `Google Genomics API`_.

Here on readthedocs, you will find documentation and tutorials for 
common tasks including moving, transforming, and analyzing genomic data.

Some pages here are specific to using Google Genomics while
others demonstrate using common genomics tools and accomplishing tasks
on Google Cloud independent of Google Genomics.
