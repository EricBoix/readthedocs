Get your ``client_id`` and ``client_secrets`` by visiting the following page:

  https://console.developers.google.com/project/_/apiui/credential

After you select your Google Cloud project, this link will
automatically take you to the Credentials tab under the API Manager.

1. Select **New credentials**
2. Select **OAuth client ID**
3. Under **Application Type** choose **Other**
4. Give your client ID a name, so you can remember why it was created (suggestion: |client_id_name|)
5. Select **Create**

After successful creation, the interface should display your client ID
and client secret.

You can find these values at any time by returning the Credentials tab
and clicking on the name you specified in step 4 above.
