There are a collection of quality control checks for variants documented in codelab `Quality Control using Google Genomics`_.

To make use of this upon your own data:

(1) First, load your data into Google Genomics and export your variants to BigQuery.  See :doc:`../load_data/index` for more detail as to how to do this.
(2) Each section of `the codelab <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/tree/master/R/PlatinumGenomes-QC>`_ discusses how to run that part on your own data.  For example, update the BigQuery table name in `Part 1: Data Overview <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/blob/master/R/PlatinumGenomes-QC/Data-Overview.md#variants>`_
