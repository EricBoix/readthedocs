Want to use BigQuery to understand cancer? The Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) has made public a great dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas, including genetic variants, clinical data, gene expression, and methylation from 33 different tumor types. It's part of their `Cancer Genomics Cloud`_, funded by the National Cancer Institute. They've also created public `examples in Python <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python>`_ and `examples in R <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-R>`_ so you can try out sample queries and analyses in `Google Cloud Datalab`_.
